## Introduction

This to-do list app is my first React project. It's designed to be user-friendly and helps users stay organized by providing a straightforward way to manage their tasks.  I created this project to learn and apply core React concepts.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks with a title and description.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks when they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Local Storage:** To-do items are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that tasks are persistent even after the browser is closed.
- **Client-Side Routing:**  The app includes an "About" section, accessible through client-side routing using `react-router-dom`.

## Technologies Used

- **React:**  The core library for building the user interface.
- **React Router DOM:** For client-side routing.
- **CSS:** For styling the application. (Specify if you used a framework like Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)

## How to Run

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start  // or yarn start
2. Open the app in your browser: The app should automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000. If not, navigate to this URL manually.

## About

This project was a valuable learning experience, solidifying my understanding of fundamental React concepts such as:

-**Components:** The app is structured using reusable components.
-**Props:** Data is passed between components using props.
-**State Management:** The useState hook manages the application's state.
-**Event Handling:** Event handlers manage user interactions.
